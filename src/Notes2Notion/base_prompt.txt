Create a new page titled "{title}"
using the source page with ID {notion_page_id}.
I will provide a draft below.
From this draft, extract and send absolutely all the content to the Notion page.
If the draft is long, split it into multiple Notion block creation calls (max 1500 characters per block).
Ensure all content is uploaded sequentially until complete.
Use the following Notion block types:
---------------------------------
heading_1 / heading_2 – For section and subsection titles
→ Preserve and use numbered titles (e.g., "1. Introduction", "2.1 Risk Mitigation")
paragraph – For standard text
bulleted_list_item – For unordered lists or key points
numbered_list_item – For step-by-step instructions, ordered items
quote – To highlight key definitions, insights, or quotes
callout – To emphasize tips, warnings, or essential ideas
code – For code snippets, prompt examples, or commands
toggle – For collapsible sections like detailed explanations or FAQs
to_do – For learning objectives or checklist-style tasks
